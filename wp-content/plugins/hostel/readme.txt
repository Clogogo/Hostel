== Description ==

Hostel is online booking system with easy back-end management. 
You can publish the booking forms, room calendars, and room lists with shortcodes so the plugin fits any WordPress theme.

- Set unavailable dates when you are on vacations or just don't want to accept guests in some rooms
- Manage bookings, process payments, contact customers

- Supports iCal / .ics to synchronize bookings with online systems. You can export and import bookings to/from all popular booking sites like Booking.com, AirBnB.com, Hotels.com etc.
- Localization / translation - ready
- Mobile / touch - friendly

There are more and better features + premium support in the PRO version. Check it on our new site: [wp-hostel.com](http://wp-hostel.com "Hostel PRO") 

###Getting Started###

1. Go to Hostel link in your admin menu to manage your rooms and rates.
2. Use the shortcodes to install a list of your rooms or to add the booking code to a post or page where you have described your rooms.
3. Set up unavailable dates if you have such.

###Shortcodes###

- [wphostel-list] will display a table with your available rooms. A date selector on the top lets the user choose dates of their visit and then the rooms list is updated. If you have enabled booking in your Hostel settings page, the table will also show "Book" button when appropriate. The button will automaically load the booking form. You can pass the attribute "max_days" to specify the maximum day interval that can be selected to show the table.

- [wphostel-booking] displays a generic booking form with a drop-down selector for choosing room, and a date selector. If you use the [wphostel-list] shortcode you most probably do not need this one because the booking form is automatically generated.

For translating the plugin check the Help page under the Hostel menu in your administration.

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "Hostel" in your menu and manage the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I import bookings from sites like Booking.com etc? =

Yes. Each room supports multiple iCal URLs. You can get the iCal URL from your control panel at the sites that provide it. Most popular booking sites do provide you with iCal URL

= I have problems with receiving emails =

Hostel just sends the emails to your WP installaiton so if emails are not delivered this is most likely a problem with your installation. We suggest installing a free plugin like [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) or [Postman SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/) to test and improve your emails delivery. Hostel will automatically send its emails through any SMTP plugin you have installed.

== Screenshots ==

3. Add/Edit booking. As admin you can review and edit bookings made from users and manually add bookings made by phone or email
